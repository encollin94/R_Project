## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Ground Clearance and Vehicle Length, all of these are showing less than 0.05 for Pr
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No, there is a coefficient in each variable.
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
This model overall has a value that is less than p<0.05m, which mean it is significant.

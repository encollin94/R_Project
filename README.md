## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![pIC](https://github.com/encollin94/R_Project/blob/main/MechaCarcHALLENGE_sNIPPET.png)
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Ground Clearance and Vehicle Length, all of these are showing less than 0.05 for Pr
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No, there is a coefficient in each variable.
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
This model overall has a value that is less than p<0.05m, which mean it is significant.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not? LOT1 and LOT2 meet these specifications as both of their variance are under 100psi. However, lot3 does not meet these expectation as their variance is at 170 psi. The average of all the variance of the lots is under 100 psi, coming in at about 60 psi.
